       Hello Rakshitha,<br><br>

  <strong>HAPPY BIRTHDAY LOVEEEE.</strong><br><br>

  I just want you to know that you are one of the most special people to me,
  and I hope I mean the same to you 😭.<br><br>

  You are one of the kindest and sweetest people I’ve ever met,
  and I thank you so much for taking a chance on me in the 11th grade.
  If not, who knows what would’ve happened.
  I don’t think all the things that I write here, in trying to express my gratitude,
  would ever be enough (also not enough space ☹️).<br><br>

  I hope that you never lose the virtues that you have,
  and moreover, I hope that you never let go of us.
  I know I’m not easy to deal with,
  but you have been the most wonderful person to me.
  If any day anybody says otherwise, don’t believe them —
  because they don’t understand you and they don’t know you.<br><br>

  You know yourself,
  and you are a beautiful, kind, smart, awesome,
  most crazy, most down-to-earth person there is.
  I know life has not been easy,
  but I hope that things sort themselves out.
  But hope is not a strategy,
  and yet I have confidence in you,
  because you’re the sort of person who finds a way
  (hope you find your way to me 🤗).<br><br>

  I cannot wait to come there,
  and I really, really hope that you don’t 🏃 run away 😭.
  I cannot wait to come there and give you a tight bear hug 🫂🥰,
  whenever that is.<br><br>

  If any day you need me,
  I am here.
  Always remember that.<br><br>

  Also, you owe me a lot of Hot Wheels 🏎️, myoman
  (my woman — idk if you remember).
  And I will buy you all the tiramisus you want.
  I hope that all your dreams come true,
  and someday you own a beautiful house,
  with a beautiful family,
  and a beautiful partner ( who you met under a starry sky on a beach ) who loves you,
  and y’all live on the slopes of a snowy mountain.<br><br>

  (Oh, and I secretly hope that you blush when you read this 🤣.)<br><br>

  Yours truly,<br>
  The idiot (yours)<br><br>

  There’s more — keep going …
      </p>
